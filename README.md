# HeartEditor
A game engine with editor, that doesn't suck.
This is meant to be almost 1-to-1 with Unity, with one goal in mind: Compiles to LÖVR project.

# Build
No build instructions yet. Just grab HeartEditor folder and run it with LÖVR.

# Known Issues
* Does not work on Linux with NVIDIA Optimus selected to dGPU only
  We can do nothing about this, sorry
